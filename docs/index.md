# Welcome!

  <p>Hello! I'm Jonathon Quick, a versatile and passionate programmer with a strong foundation in Python and a growing interest in web development. I am based in Switzerland (Canton Bern). My journey in programming began in 2009, when I delved into the world of indie game development tutorials using C# and XNA Game Studio for Xbox 360. However, I didn't build anything substantial back then and it was just an introduction. Over the years, I've experimented with various programming languages, including Python, C#, JavaScript, and Rust.</p>

In 2022, I decided to take programming more seriously and dipped my toes into the freelancing sphere. While my experience as a freelancer was brief, it helped me hone my skills in Python, which has become my strongest programming language. My portfolio showcases a selection of Python projects, primarily focused on trading, in the realms of cryptocurrency and forex. To ensure the highest quality, I document my code with mkdocs and provide clear, concise comments.

As I continue to grow as a developer, I aim to expand my horizons by creating web applications, focusing primarily on back-end development using Django or Flask. However, I'm also eager to learn front-end technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue. My approach to development involves writing pseudo-code and creating PlantUML diagrams to visualize the planned logic & architecture before diving into implementation.

Though I have yet to hold a formal developer position, I'm confident in my ability to learn new technologies, contribute quality code and become a valuable team member. I speak both English and German and can provide documentation in either language, or both if needed.

Take a look at my portfolio to explore my projects. Here is a list of my projects (you can also use the sidebar to navigate):

  - [**N2 Pairs Trader**](projects/n2-pairs-trader.md)
  - [**News Trading Analyzer**](projects/news-trading-analyzer.md)
  - [**Telegram Signal Trader**](projects/telegram-signal-trader.md)

You can view my github profile [here](https://github.com/spliffli). I don't know why, but not all of my commits seem to appear on my profile overview. It might be something to do with my ssh key's name not matching my username? In reality, I have been pushing code to the News Trading Analyzer repo almost daily for the past 2 months.

I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and create innovative solutions together.
